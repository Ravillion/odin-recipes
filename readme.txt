My First Project for  The Odin Project

In this project I'll be creating a basic website for recipes
I'll be using HTML to setup lists,links and more. 
This file will be updated upon completion to explain things I learned,
errors encountered along the way and my overall review of the lesson.



My Initial Process,Discoveries & Review:

While writing the code for the following basic websites I found
the odin projects course had me well prepared for the setup of links,lists and paragraphs,
along the way I had no real issues setting up the links or pages. However I will say that along the way
I did have issues with images being far too large to look even half presentable,now I know this is my
first setup of a website and its meant to be a more basic level.

That being said I'd have loved the odin project to cover resizing images beforehand, a quick search on my own
found my results giving me a much better scale to the recipe pages overall. Im certain that these details will
be covered later in the program but its a small detail I'd liked to have touched on, my only other notable
detail was that when previously learning on The Odin Project they'd mentioned the good habit of including
Rel="noopener noreferrer" lines when setting up a website. 

though I included these myself, I'd have liked the program to have asked for these details along with
screen reader support on the images to really drive these skills home. Overall it was a very fun first project
though I know I have lots to learn going foreward I am eager to look back and see what I've learned.
